A lot of people appear to be chattering away since ages about how they<br />
want to the Democrats doing something - <i>anything</i> at all. The<br />
Democrats, in response, say that they don't have the power to do<br />
anything.<br />
</p>

<p>
This is true - if we were talking about following the rules. But we're<br />
no longer in that era where rules define the politics of the day. The<br />
Democrats have to just bite the bullet and accept that those days, at<br />
least for now, are long gone. The Republicans haven't been following the<br />
rules since a decade, and I'm left wondering when the Democrats are<br />
going to realize that they have to stop playing by the rules and win?<br />
</p>

<p>
While the fascist Trump administration is literally destroying America<br />
from inside and without, the Democrats seem to be under the impression<br />
that they should be waiting until the mid-term elections. This is a huge<br />
mistake, and they appear to be very unclear on messaging. Well, I'd like<br />
to propose a clear, easy, simple, and comprehensive winning strategy for<br />
the Democrats:<br />
</p>

<p>
The <i>first</i> Democrat to get up on the podium and start <i>screaming</i> into<br />
the microphone the following sentence: "Trump and his administration are<br />
fucking traitors and they're going to fucking hang!" is going to get<br />
more than half of the country behind them.<br />
</p>

<p>
Let me put this into perspective: One "strategy" the Democrats have<br />
about stopping the Trump Administration is wondering how many<br />
Republicans they can convince to join them to vote against Trump. But,<br />
as everyone knows, and has been admitted in so many articles <i>ad<br />
nauseam</i> is how the Republicans literally fear for their lives. They<br />
won't be joining the Democrats anytime soon.<br />
</p>

<p>
You're not going to convince Republicans to join you because they're<br />
more afraid of the Trump mob than they are of anything the Democrats<br />
could ever do.<br />
</p>

<p>
Allow me to propose a way to fix this: Democrats have to make<br />
Republicans fear the Democrat mob far, <i>far,</i> more than they fear the<br />
Republican one. That, in the end, will get those traitors to switch<br />
sides and vote against Trump and his traitorous cronies.<br />
</p>

<p>
Yes, yes, I know that Democrats don't act this way in normal times. But,<br />
as I said: these are no longer normal times. Trump has unleashed the<br />
fucking mob as a political tool, and the way you counter such an army<br />
isn't with votes and pieces of paper: it's by fighting in bigger numbers<br />
and with harder swings.<br />
</p>

<p>
One thing that the Republicans are right about when it comes to<br />
Democrats: We, as a group, don't know how to fight a war. It doesn't<br />
matter what war we're talking about - we're fucking inept at it. And<br />
this is a war. It's a civil war which is going to have to be fought in<br />
the streets and on the political landscape.<br />
