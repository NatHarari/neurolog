It's a day for ranting. Either that, or completely ignoring what is<br />
about to happen in a few hours. I've made it no secret as to my feelings<br />
on what I think about Trump, his supporters, and the electorate at<br />
large. I couldn't think of a worse situation to befall the United States<br />
and the rest of the world as what is about to take place.<br />
</p>

<p>
The public at large are fucking idiots. That probably includes people<br />
you know whom are close to you. It sure does with me. But one thing I've<br />
done a long time ago is cut those people off - including family members<br />
who support this traitor and this virulent populism and idiotic<br />
nationalism. I have no regrets on that score whatsoever. What I do<br />
regret is their existence, and I regret that not only for myself, but<br />
for the world entire.<br />
</p>

<p>
But that's not something I can do anything about, and neither can I do<br />
anything about what is going to happen in the next few years. I've leave<br />
the Cassandra-like predictions for another time, though I will say that<br />
for the last few years, I feel like Claudius witnessing the decline of<br />
the republic in his old age.<br />
</p>

What I am going to rant about, rather quickly, is Apple "Intelligence".<br />
I've had it for a while on my Mac, and it's pretty much useless. But<br />
it's not the GPT model which is inherently useless, because it has some<br />
uses which can be positive. Instead, for some reason, it's the UI.<br />
</p>

<p>
You see, when you chat with GPT, you usually do it in a web page with<br />
saved scrollback and history. But not so with Apple "Intelligence". It's<br />
a clunky UI which has a semi-floating window, but there's no saved<br />
history - at least none which I can find. But if there is, it's not on<br />
by default. This makes long conversations completely useless. You'd<br />
think that a company which is known for their ease of use and handy UI<br />
designs would have got this basic functionality correct, but they<br />
didn't. I have no idea who thought this would be a great way to proceed,<br />
but they were dead wrong. I know that a lot of people have been upset<br />
about how useless Image Playground is (and this is completely true), but<br />
the general AI is just worse. Let's face it: Apple just completely<br />
fucked up their "Intelligence" rollout and they have to fix it<br />
post-haste.<br />
