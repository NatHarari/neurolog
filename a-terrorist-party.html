<p>
I want to be absolutely clear: I mean that the Republicans are a<br />
terrorist party in the exact same way as Hamas is a terrorist party in<br />
most democracies (including the United States).<br />
</p>

<p>
This is a political party which supported, and still supports, political<br />
violence to overthrow the democratically elected government of the<br />
United States - and a good chunk of which wants to install a theocratic<br />
government in its stead. Replace "Republican" with <i>any</i> other name, and<br />
you would get a declaration that this party, this movement, this<br />
organization is a political terrorist organization.<br />
</p>

<p>
For some reason, Americans have their heads stuck up their collective<br />
asses when it comes to these things. The left is trying to rationalize<br />
some sort of imbecilic need for "decorum" and "tradition". I've heard<br />
countless talking heads recount countless times how we just don't charge<br />
our former Presidents with a crime because it is not our "tradition".<br />
</p>

<p>
You know what else isn't in our tradition? Trying to overthrow the<br />
government with a literal violent coup. That's never happened before<br />
either.<br />
</p>

<p>
Let me explain to people about tradition: We can <i>create</i> tradition.<br />
Have you ever heard of the Nuremberg trials? Charging people for<br />
Genocide was literally never done before in modern legal history (let<br />
alone ancient history). This was a first. And there's a reason why it's<br />
a legal framework now: because we <i>invented</i> it to deal with a new<br />
situation. We didn't just throw our hands up and say that we didn't have<br />
a "tradition" of charging people with crimes against humanity. We<br />
created the conditions in which we <i>could</i> do that as a <i>response</i> to a<br />
new situation.<br />
</p>

<p>
When I was young, we all idolized Lincoln. Do you think that Lincoln had<br />
a framework for fighting a civil war? Do you think that he had a<br />
framework for freeing the slaves? No. But it seems that Americans, back<br />
then, were absolutely willing to respond to situations by creating new<br />
frameworks and not necessarily invoking tradition as an excuse to do<br />
nothing.<br />
</p>

<p>
I suggest that we take a page out of that book. Yes, it's true: We<br />
<i>don't</i> have a "tradition" of charging ex-Presidents with crimes, but we<br />
are faced with the situation for the first time in our country's history<br />
wherein we <i>need</i> to charge him with crimes - egregious crimes. And we<br />
need to create a framework in which we don't just shrug it off because<br />
it's "not traditional", buck up, and do it. And if his followers decide<br />
to react with violence, then we <i>deal</i> with them as well.<br />
