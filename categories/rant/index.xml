      <description>Posted to Facebook: It has recently been brought to my attention that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really said anything on here in a very, very, very long time and just post polar bear pictures.
Very true. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s a good reason for this, and I wrote about it before I stopped posting and responding: I don&amp;rsquo;t trust Facebook and, worse, I would dismantle it if I could for what they have helped to do to our country, and many other countries around the world.</description>
