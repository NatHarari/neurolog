As a fun little experiment last night, I had ChatGPT write out a little<br />
Dungeons and Dragons adventure. From what I learned: You can get ChatGPT<br />
to be really specific and detailed. There are a few tricks which my<br />
repeated attempts have taught me:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You have to be really specific and detailed in your query. You can<br />
make it a very long sentence. I'll post mine below so that you can<br />
see. It probably could have gone better but it was about 30 minutes<br />
before I went to sleep so I was fairly tired.<br /></li>

<li>You can ask it questions based on previous queries so it knows what<br />
you're talking about. This means that if the output is too long,<br />
break it down into a sort of outline. Then ask questions about each<br />
sub-item. It will know what you're referring to.<br /></li>

<li>Every time it generates something, it will be slightly or even hugely<br />
different - it depends what you're asking it to do. So if the first<br />
attempt doesn't succeed, try again. Even trying again with the same<br />
query will have a different output.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>
I wanted this to be a little adventure about my friend Josh and I from<br />
our heyday back in the mid-80s. The Trident of Fish Command is a<br />
continual joke with us since almost 40 years as it was one of the prizes<br />
in a hoard of an adventure which sent us roaring into laughter. We<br />
deemed this to be one of the most useless magical items in D&amp;D at the<br />
time. We still joke about it today fairly regularly to denote something<br />
utterly useless. (You may have had to be there to get the entirety of<br />
the joke**<br />
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>My Query:</b> Write a detailed Dungeons and Dragons adventure. It must<br />
contain the following: Joshus Kolchinus is a Dwarven Cleric who is also<br />
a librarian. His friend, Slartibart, is a surly old mage who cackles at<br />
the misfortunes of his enemies. They start in a tavern and have at least<br />
five paragraphs of conversation of previous adventures together. Detail<br />
the tavern, the cost of the beer and rooms, and what they are equipped<br />
with as well. Then they hear of a dungeon not far away from a<br />
conversation next to them. Detail the surrounding area outside of the<br />
dungeon with at least 3 encounters. Detail all of the encounters with<br />
monsters as well as their treasure. Each encouter rewards includes gold,<br />
silver, jewels, items, and magical items. Detail all of that. Then, they<br />
enter the Dungeon. The dungeon has at least 30 rooms and at least 12<br />
encounters with random monsters. Detail all of the monsters. They also<br />
have treasure which can include gold, silver, copper, electrum, magical<br />
items and jewels. Detail each treasure hoard. The dungeon also has<br />
several traps, which you need to detail as well, and it also has 3<br />
puzzles, which also need to be detailed. At the end of the dungeon is a<br />
vast cavern with a sea serpent, which needs to have detailed statistics<br />
as well, and a vast treasure hoard containing gold, silver, electrum,<br />
copper, jewels, art, and magical items. All of this has to be detailed.<br />
It also contains a trident of fish command as the main prize which also<br />
needs details. I need the statistics of each monster in each encounter<br />
as well as the statistics of each item found in the dungeon. I also need<br />
the details of the puzzles and traps. List all of the monster details at<br />
the end of the adventure. And write out a text map of the surrounding<br />
area outside and the dungeon inside.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Result:</b><br />
</p>

<p>
Title: The Quest for the Trident of Fish Command<br />
</p>

<p>
Joshus Kolchinus, a Dwarven Cleric, and his friend, Slartibart, a surly<br />
old mage, sit at a wooden table in the smoky, dimly lit tavern. The<br />
tavern is packed with travelers, adventurers, and locals all in search<br />
of a drink and a story. Joshus and Slartibart order two frothy mugs of<br />
ale and begin recounting their past adventures together over a plate of<br />
roasted boar.<br />
</p>

<p>
As they reminisce, they overhear a group of adventurers at the next<br />
table mentioning a nearby dungeon rumored to be filled with treasure.<br />
The two friends perk up their ears and make their way over to listen in<br />
on the conversation. After a few moments of eavesdropping, they learn<br />
that the dungeon is located just a few miles west of the tavern, near a<br />
dense forest. Excited by the prospect of treasure, Joshus and Slartibart<br />
head to the bar to pay for their ale and rooms.<br />
</p>

<p>
The cost of a mug of ale is 1 silver piece, and the cost of a room for<br />
the night is 5 gold pieces. The rooms are equipped with a sturdy bed, a<br />
wooden chest for storing personal belongings, and a small table and<br />
chair for writing. Joshus and Slartibart each purchase a room for the<br />
night.<br />
</p>

<p>
As they prepare to set out to the dungeon the next morning, they<br />
encounter three different obstacles on the way:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A group of goblins attempting to rob travelers on the road. The<br />
goblins are armed with rusty swords and makeshift shields. The party<br />
defeats the goblins and finds a small treasure hoard containing 75<br />
silver pieces and a Potion of Healing.<br /></li>

<li>A bridge over a rushing river has collapsed, forcing the party to<br />
either wade through the icy water or find another way across. They<br />
eventually find a fallen tree that can be used as a makeshift bridge.<br /></li>

<li>A group of wolves block the path, snarling and baring their teeth.<br />
The party successfully scares off the wolves with a well-timed<br />
Thunderwave spell from Slartibart. They find a small treasure hoard<br />
containing 50 silver pieces and a Ring of Animal Friendship.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>
The dungeon has 35 rooms, and the party encounters 12 different types of<br />
monsters. Here are the details of the encounters, along with the<br />
treasure found:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A group of skeletons guarding a small room. The skeletons wield rusty<br />
swords and shields. The treasure hoard contains 100 copper pieces and<br />
a Potion of Water Breathing.<br /></li>

<li>A mimic disguised as a treasure chest. The mimic lashes out at the<br />
party with its sticky tentacles. The treasure hoard contains 300 gold<br />
pieces and a Wand of Magic Missiles.<br /></li>

<li>A group of orcs lounging in a common room. The orcs are armed with<br />
battleaxes and shields. The treasure hoard contains 200 gold pieces<br />
and a Scroll of Protection from Energy.<br /></li>

<li>A pack of giant spiders lurking in a web-filled corridor. The spiders<br />
pounce on the party with their venomous fangs. The treasure hoard<br />
contains 150 silver pieces and a Bag of Holding.<br /></li>

<li>A swarm of rats in a kitchen. The rats scurry and squeak as they<br />
attack the party. The treasure hoard contains 75 copper pieces and a<br />
Ring of Jumping.<br /></li>

<li>A group of lizardfolk guards defending a key to a locked door. The<br />
lizardfolk use their sharp claws to attack. The treasure hoard<br />
contains 500 silver pieces and a Staff of Frost.<br /></li>

<li>A room filled with animated furniture, including a chair, a table,<br />
and a chandelier. The furniture comes to life and attacks the party.<br />
The treasure hoard contains 350 gold pieces and a Wand of Fireballs.<br /></li>

<li>A pit with a gelatinous cube lurking inside. The cube engulfs the<br />
party members, attempting to digest them. The treasure hoard contains<br />
100 electrum pieces and a Cloak of Elvenkind.<br /></li>

<li>A group of kobolds defending their treasure hoard. The kobolds use<br />
cunning traps and ambush tactics to attack the party. The treasure<br />
hoard contains 300 copper pieces and a Ring of Shielding.<br /></li>

<li>A dark, damp room with a patch of mold growing on the wall. The mold<br />
releases a cloud of poisonous spores. The treasure hoard contains<br />
250 silver pieces and a Potion of Invisibility.<br /></li>

<li>A group of ghouls, reanimated corpses with sharp claws and teeth.<br />
The ghouls lunge at the party, attempting to paralyze them. The<br />
treasure hoard contains 400 gold pieces and a Staff of Healing.<br /></li>

<li>A beholder, a floating eyeball monster with multiple eye stalks. The<br />
beholder attacks the party with its disintegration ray and<br />
telekinetic ray. The treasure hoard contains 1000 gold pieces and a<br />
Wand of Polymorph.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>
Along the way, the party also encounters several traps and puzzles:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A pressure plate in the floor of a narrow hallway triggers a trap<br />
that unleashes a hail of poisoned darts. The party must either find a<br />
way around the plate or disarm the trap.<br /></li>

<li>A riddle inscribed on a stone tablet blocks the way to one of the<br />
rooms. The party must decipher the riddle to proceed.<br /></li>

<li>A room filled with mirrors and illusions. The party must use keen<br />
observation to identify the correct path through the maze of mirrors.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>
At the end of the dungeon, the party enters a vast cavern with a massive<br />
sea serpent coiled in the center. The serpent lashes out at the party<br />
with its sharp teeth and tail. Here are the sea serpent's statistics:<br />
</p>

<p>

Languages: &#x2014; Challenge: 15 (13,000 XP) Actions: Multiattack, Bite,<br />

</p>

<p>
The treasure hoard in the cavern contains 2000 gold pieces, 5000 silver<br />
pieces, 1000 electrum pieces, 500 copper pieces, a painting of a famous<br />
hero worth 10,000 gold pieces, a Diamond of Synthesis, and the prized<br />
Trident of Fish Command. Here are the trident's statistics:<br />
</p>

<p>
Trident of Fish Command Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement)<br />
This trident has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. It has 3<br />
charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its<br />
charges to cast Dominate Beast (save DC 15) from it on a beast that has<br />
an innate swimming speed. The trident regains 1d3 expended charges daily<br />
at dawn.<br />

<p>
This took several attempts and I refined the question each time. I know<br />
it wasn't the best method to use, but it ended up working. I believe I<br />
ran out of tokens for the Ghouls which should be 11, but no matter. The<br />
example is clear enough and the adventure is fairly complete. You can,<br />
as a Dungeon Master, create an entire module pretty quickly (each output<br />
only took 1 or 2 seconds to start scrolling out). You could, for<br />
instance, work on each "Chapter" or "Section" one at a time and get a<br />
much more refined dungeon or adventure. What used to take hours to do<br />
can now be done in a matter of seconds. Of course, it won't be instant.<br />
There's a lot of refining to do, a lot of attempts to make it work, but<br />
it will still save you a tremendous amount of time.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm absolutely certain that there are much better and more detailed<br />
adventures out there already created with ChatGPT, but I didn't go<br />
looking for them at all yet. I just wanted to use it as an experiment to<br />
learn how to use the interface and tailor the results. I think that it<br />
worked very well overall. It can still use some work, but it's a bang-up<br />
job for having come up with this result in only one or two seconds.<br />
