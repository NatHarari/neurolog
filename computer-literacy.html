I'm going to say something completely impolitic, but I don't really care<br />
at this point about appearances:<br />
</p>

<p>
I just have the feeling that most people are too stupid to actually<br />
figure out how easy #Mastodon is to use because of:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Choice and<br /></li>
<li>Unfamiliarity<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>
I remember when the internet was in its heyday (I was on it back in 1989<br />
actually - but that's another story) and we had such high hopes for<br />
humanity learning, growing, and communicating together.<br />
</p>

<p>
You had to sort of figure out a lot back then: How to hook up a modem,<br />
how to dial in, how to download a browser, find things, and even setting<br />
up your email was a chore. It took a lot of learning back then.<br />
</p>

<p>
But then the ugly head of filthy lucre reared its head and decided that<br />
what was best was to dumb it down, force a single choice upon users, and<br />
we know the rest of the story.<br />
</p>

<p>
The fact is: Most people have simply never learned how to "use" the<br />
internet. They know a few sites such as Google, Facebook, Instagram,<br />
etc&#x2026; but that's all they ever learned. And when you sign up to those<br />
sites, you're not given any choices; they are all made for you. What<br />
used to take about 10-60 minutes of figuring out now takes about 3<br />
clicks. Hell, it's been 30 years and they still don't know how to pick a<br />
secure password. They never "picked" Gmail either. They just went to<br />
gmail, typed in a name with a stupid number, and that was it. The same<br />
goes for Twitter and Facebook and the rest.<br />
</p>

<p>
Not only that: It would populate your entire friend list with your<br />
contacts. You don't even have to start from 0. And it would do so<br />
automatically just by clicking "Yes" when asked about it.<br />
</p>

<p>
Whenever I help people with "computers" (never a specific, just<br />
"computers" in general), they're still asking me the same basic<br />
questions they should have learned 25 years ago. They've never learned.<br />
Ever.<br />
</p>

<p>
So, asking them to pick a Mastodon instance? Well, it's as easy as<br />
choosing an email server. But they never did that to begin with. They<br />
don't even understand the concept of it. They use "computers" ever day<br />
(in the form of a phone for many) but they still have no idea what<br />
they're actually doing.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm not advocating that we teach everyone how to program, but basic<br />
computer literacy would be good.<br />
</p>

<p>
But then the question: Whom, exactly, is "we"? Well, that would have to<br />
be the local education system. And while great strides have been made,<br />
it's not enough. People have been learning "about" computers for a<br />
decade and a half in class now, but I still don't see the rewards of it<br />
online. Sure, more people are in tech now, but what exactly has been the<br />
overall experience for most? Most people - even "young people" - still<br />
don't know how they generally work.<br />
