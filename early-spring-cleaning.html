It's time for an early spring cleaning.<br />
</p>

<p>
I know, it's only February, but I have to Get Shit Done(tm)<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm going to try Trademarking that at some point. "Getting Things Done"<br />
is too lackadaisical to mean that you're getting serious, in my<br />
opinion - with all due respect to David Allen. "Things" just doesn't<br />
convey the necessity of some tasks which have to get done for me in my<br />
life at this point.<br />

I used to go to sleep past dawn. Literally. I'm sure we all have, but I<br />
used to do it with an insane regularity which made other people wince<br />
when they heard about my lifestyle. And now, it's the reverse. I like<br />
waking up early. I like waking up before the sun rises. I relish the<br />
quiet time in the wee hours of the morning when barely anyone is walking<br />
about outside. It's the same feeling I got while staying up extremely<br />
late all through the night. Only now, I wake up and don't feel like most<br />
of the day has gone past and that I have to rush to do anything at all<br />
in the world outside. It's a calming feeling.<br />

Since I was one of the first people to be invited to the beta test of<br />
Gmail back in 2001 or 2002 (I honestly can't remember, it was so long<br />
ago), I have emails which date back from that time. I regularly delete<br />
things, but I still have over 103,000 messages, which is too many.<br />
Frankly, what am I going to do with a "Welcome to Houzz!" email from<br />
2005? Why would I honestly need that? It's nice to know that I've been a<br />
member of certain sites from paleolithic times, back when WiFi wasn't<br />
even a thing, but is it honestly necessary to store that forever? I<br />
think not. So, part of the spring cleaning is for files. It gets me<br />
motivated to delete things in my real life when I start deleting swathes<br />
of useless crap in my digital life. And I'm glad that I've been deleting<br />
useless stuff all of these years since I'd think that number would<br />
probably be closer to 1,000,000 Emails or more if I hadn't.<br />
</p>

<p>
My every day goal since many years is Inbox Zero, which I've held up<br />
pretty well to be a standard for myself over the years. Emacs has,<br />
naturally helped with this. I suppose I could use Apple Mail to do it<br />
now, as it has timed reminders on emails, but I haven't yet looked up<br />
how to utilize this function without leaving the email in my inbox,<br />
which I refuse to do. I'm quite certain that it's fairly simple to do<br />
however, but I like how I can reference archived emails in Emacs to read<br />
later or get back to directly to my inbox.org file.<br />

I've cleaned out a ton of stuff from my emails, but it'll be ongoing for<br />
a while. Also: I've decided to sync org-agenda with my Nextcloud<br />
instance. I only got it working for one-way sync at the moment, but I'm<br />
working on it.<br />
