<p>
It has recently been brought to my attention that I haven't really said<br />
anything on here in a very, very, very long time and just post polar<br />
bear pictures.<br />
</p>

<p>
Very true. Well, there's a good reason for this, and I wrote about it<br />
before I stopped posting and responding: I don't trust Facebook and,<br />
worse, I would dismantle it if I could for what they have helped to do<br />
to our country, and many other countries around the world. In earnest, I<br />
think that people should stop using it. I really do.<br />
</p>

<p>
I realize, however, that this is not going to happen. Most people use<br />
Facebook and don't know anything more technical than that. I realize,<br />
with sadness, that we're all pushing the wagon which will eventually run<br />
civilization off of a cliff - at least in the format that it exists<br />
today. And the same goes for Twitter and most social media.<br />
</p>

<p>
I know, people think it's harmless fun, or the only way to keep in touch<br />
with their friends and family. But let me tell you something: If you're<br />
angry as hell about what has happened in the last seven years, then you<br />
should realize that it isn't harmless fun. It isn't just sharing photos.<br />
It's supporting a literal regime which is causing massive chaos<br />
throughout the world. And if you think I'm exaggerating, then you<br />
haven't learned anything about what is going on.<br />
</p>

<p>
Look at how it entirely dominates every single sphere of our lives, and<br />
not in a good way. Even media companies that are tasked with criticizing<br />
Facebook have to literally <i>post on Facebook</i> to get their links<br />
noticed. Exactly how twisted is that? And nobody has even commented on<br />
this particular twist in any forum which I've yet to see. it's just<br />
accepted as normal. It isn't. It is absolutely sick and twisted for this<br />
to be the case.<br />
</p>

<p>
Again: I realize I'm not going to change any minds because everyone is a<br />
fucking slave to this thing and rationalises it in their minds because<br />
they don't have time to do something differently, or don't want to break<br />
off contacts, or like having people notice their food they're eating -<br />
all while Facebook does social experiments on them which are destroying<br />
our democracies. Instead of not posting several pictures of their outing<br />
or comments on somebody else's food, they <i>could</i> take the time to learn<br />
how to do something differently. But they don't. They <i>could</i> go back to<br />
relying on RSS feeds for their news directly from the best sources and<br />
not buried in a sea of utter bullshit and nonsense which floods our<br />
screens every day.<br />
</p>

<p>
I have so much more to say on that, but I know that it won't make a<br />
bloody difference. I also know that I might get some responses about how<br />
I'm exaggerating, in the exact same way people said I was exaggerating<br />
when I said that Trump would probably win, or when I said that Trump<br />
would probably foment a literal coup to stay in power. "You're<br />
exaggerating, it isn't that bad." I was told over and over again. When I<br />
said that Republicans were going to take away our rights with a<br />
Theocracy years before Trump finally did it, I was told that I was<br />
"exaggerating".<br />
</p>

<p>
Do you want to make a bet how little I'm "exaggerating" over this?<br />
</p>

<p>
You know, I get it: learning something about computers is difficult for<br />
most people. They just don't "get" technology. They want something<br />
simple and easy, even if it means they're trapping themselves forever.<br />
It's one reason I also no longer really use Gmail. I woke up and<br />
realized how literally almost every site identified me with my Gmail<br />
account and that it could be taken away at a moment's notice. Imagine<br />
suddenly not being able to get emails from your bank because Gmail<br />
decided to cancel your account because you pissed off the algorithm in<br />
some way. Most things that are marketed as "free" are generally not<br />
worth it. Sometimes they are, but you have to think about it long and<br />
hard beforehand.<br />
</p>

<p>
If people would take the 3-10 hours in one day that they spend on<br />
Facebook and, instead, devote 1 hour each day to learning how to do<br />
things differently with computers, they would contribute to fixing this<br />
problem. They'd probably even enjoy the experience.<br />
</p>

<p>
But they won't do it. They would rather have <i>all</i> of their friends<br />
notice what they say instead of just a few people who know where they<br />
are posting. After all, writing into the void isn't a very satisfying<br />
feeling for most people, and neither is posting a picture which no one<br />
will ever see. I get it. I do. So, suddenly, we've given Facebook the<br />
authority of being the forum for everything we do, say, see, taste, and<br />
experience in our lives. They've become the gatekeeprs of the public<br />
forum without ever being elected to that position of responsibility.<br />
</p>

<p>
Well, not for me.<br />
</p>

<p>
So, with that being said, I've started a blog again. It's at<br />
<a href="https://www.neurolog.dev">https://www.neurolog.dev</a> where you can read more regular updates. I may<br />
even stop posting pictures here soon because, frankly, I just don't feel<br />
like doing it anymore. This is a bad place and I don't want to<br />
contribute to it. I'll keep posting this URL for a while and then you<br />
may not see me here anymore. It's not worth being here if I'm helping to<br />
contribute to the utter disaster which our societies have become. If you<br />
want to know how to read news in a better way than your fucking<br />
timeline, then take an hour of your time <i>off</i> of Facebook and look up<br />
what an RSS feed is. I've gone back to it a long while ago - I don't get<br />
bullshit news from Facebook timelines in years. It's better that way.<br />
And I couldn't care less that I'm missing the newest kitchen "hack" or<br />
other fake news idiocy that spreads on here in my timeline on a daily<br />
basis.<br />
</p>

<p>
I've been posting polar bears here every single day for&#x2026;8 years? Heck,<br />
I don't even really know and I don't care. The reason that I started<br />
doing it was because I wanted to see something first thing in the<br />
morning that at least made me somewhat happy. But seeing Facebook's<br />
interface every morning doesn't make me happy. It's a reminder of all of<br />
the above and more, and I should do away with it very soon.<br />
</p>

<p>
And so should you.<br />
