<p>
I've wanted to write this for a while: France can be extremely<br />
conservative. I'm not referencing conservative parties on the right, but<br />
the culture as a whole. This, amusingly enough, includes communists and<br />
socialists. You would think that it wouldn't, but it absolutely does.<br />
And this election, once again, shows exactly what I mean.<br />
</p>

<p>
But first, let's saunter back a few years in history to make my point:<br />
Back when the <i>gilets jaunes</i> were all over the news, they were blocking<br />
traffic everywhere - including shutting down the metro. And, of course,<br />
they would protest at <i>Place de la République</i>. I had an argument with a<br />
few of their supporters asking why they are doing that. Why, when they<br />
really want the elites to change the system, are they fucking over the<br />
little guy? After all, I take the metro, but the elites don't. Blocking<br />
the metro isn't going to send a personal message to anyone other than<br />
the people who can't change the system. I, personally, nor anyone else I<br />
know who takes the metro, can possibly change the laws of the country.<br />
</p>

<p>
I offered a solution to them to not bother the person in the street: Why<br />
don't you block all of the traffic around <i>Le palais de l'Élysée</i>? The<br />
people you want to confront are all there. They're the ones who can<br />
change the laws.<br />
</p>

<p>
Everyone I suggested this to was aghast. Quite literally. They couldn't<br />
wrap their heads around it - including even some literal communists I<br />
talked to. Their response was, quite literally, "We've always done it<br />
this way. We've always protested at République." Even the most die-hard<br />
"revolutionaries" among them could not envision a solution which would<br />
change the status quo since (quite literally) 1789. It simply was not<br />
something they could ever consider.<br />
</p>

<p>
This, naturally, is just a single anecdotal reference to my claim:<br />
French society is <i>very</i> conservative. It may come across as<br />
<i>progressive</i> from time to time, but it really, fundamentally, isn't.<br />
</p>

<p>
For instance: in this latest round of elections, the left is quite<br />
literally using the exact same stances on issues that they were back in<br />
the good old days of communism. They've never changed. Ever. Not once.<br />
In Britain and the U.S.A., the Democrats have re-invented themselves a<br />
few times over (most famously during the Clinton/Blair years). The left<br />
has never re-invented itself in France. If you talk to the guys who run<br />
it, they've been saying the exact same thing since the last 6o or 70<br />
years.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying that it's necessary to re-invent something all of the<br />
time if it works, but we know that their vision doesn't work. It's been<br />
tested - many times - and it hasn't worked. However, they can't imagine<br />
ever changing it, even if it means getting more votes and actually<br />
getting some things done. They're a bit like MAGA in a way.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying that the right here is much better. However, they <i>are</i><br />
trying to re-invent themselves - most notably to get the stench of<br />
Nazism off of their party (it isn't working very well). Granted, when<br />
your party was literally founded by a Nazi collaborator with Nazi-views,<br />
it's a bit hard to change the minds of people that you suddenly mean<br />
well because you put a new face on it.<br />
</p>

<p>
All in all, French politics hasn't changed, except for one instance:<br />
Emmanuel Macron. His centrist party was really the first breath of fresh<br />
air that France has had in the last century. But it hasn't worked. Why?<br />
Because any change to the system is deemed as too unsavory to stomach.<br />
</p>

<p>
So now, we're back to voting for a side which was quite literally<br />
founded by a Nazi collaborator (which is now very keen on telling<br />
everyone they don't like the antisemitism on the left), and a side which<br />
makes the communists in the Soviet era look like Republicans.<br />
</p>

<p>
It's a complete and utter disaster.<br />
</p>

<p>
One of the worst things that ever happened to this country, in the end,<br />
was the Revolution. It's still there, still marching in the streets, and<br />
it's unwilling to change from what it was in 1789.<br />
