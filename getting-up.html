<p>
I bought an Apple Watch several months ago. It's my first smart watch<br />
and I couldn't be happier about it.<br />
</p>

<p>
I did my research. I didn't just buy it, and obviously I didn't jump<br />
onto the bandwagon immediately after they first started coming out. It<br />
took years. I thought that it would be sort of useless for me to get<br />
one. The fact is that this is the first time I've been wearing a watch<br />
since around 1996. Back then, I went to Santa Cruz to be with my<br />
girlfriend for the summer and she forcibly removed my watch because I<br />
was obsessive about checking the time, all the time, and following a<br />
certain agenda in my head. Since then, I hadn't worn a watch - until<br />
now. 2022.<br />
</p>

<p>
That's a very long time.<br />
</p>

<p>
Like most people, I just checked my phone for the time. I thought, I<br />
didn't need a watch after all.<br />
</p>

<p>
But then I started wanting to work out and the idea hit me that to<br />
encourage myself and plan accordingly, a watch would help me. It would<br />
track my daily exercise (which it does very well), as well as monitor my<br />
sleep patterns. You see, I've been suffering for a bit of insomnia in<br />
the last year or so. This was unusual in the fact that I was always the<br />
guy who could fall asleep at the drop of a hat, anywhere, anytime. So I<br />
wanted to see what was up with my sleeping cycles as well.<br />
</p>

<p>
So I got the watch after carefully researching my options (I really took<br />
months here). I went researching sleep apps as well (I use<br />
<a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com">Sleep Cycle</a>). I subscribed for a year<br />
and it really was worth it. I've been tracking my sleep patterns every<br />
night. I went researching which app was best for this and found a guy<br />
online who is an actual sleep scientist in a lab who tests all of these<br />
apps and then gave his recommendation for the best one which mimics the<br />
equipment they use in an actual scientific lab for sleep research. He<br />
recommended Sleep Cycle, so I chose that.<br />
</p>

<p>
But the one thing I didn't realise about my watch was this: It reminds<br />
me every hour to get up and walk around for a minute. And, as it turns<br />
out, that's a good thing. You see, I get drawn into the screen like<br />
nothing else. I can sit there without moving for five or six hours and<br />
not even realize that the time has gone by. With my watch on, it not<br />
only dings a reminder, it taps my wrist - a bit hard to ignore that. Get<br />
up and walk around for a minute.<br />
</p>

<p>
So, I've started doing that. And then I started doing a bit more than<br />
that. With more task management about <i>doing</i> things instead of just<br />
doing things on the computer, I've started to get up intermittently to<br />
do things around the house. Cleaning up, putting things away, vacuuming,<br />
etc&#x2026;.<br />
</p>

<p>
What I've found is that I actually am <i>more</i> productive on the computer<br />
with these breaks in between. What I've realised is that I've been doing<br />
it all wrong. That time mostly spent where I'd be doing things, I've<br />
been drawn into just staring at pages and pages without really absorbing<br />
anything. Part of it is social media or reading the news which, frankly,<br />
I can do in very short bursts now.<br />
</p>

<p>
I know everyone has been told this, but I've found it to actually be<br />
true. For some reason, when I look at my daily log (which I've started<br />
keeping in a journal in Emacs), it has been getting more and more full<br />
of actual computer tasks as well as daily tasks now that I've been<br />
taking breaks to do things around the house. So it's not just me<br />
imagining it since I have an actual log of everything I do every day.<br />
</p>

<p>
I don't feel as if I'm missing out on anything at all and, as a plus, my<br />
place is starting to get much nicer to live in.<br />
</p>

<p>
It's a good thing.<br />
