I haven't written here in donkey's years. Again. It's hard to find<br />
inspiration to write when the world has just gone to shit since such a<br />
very long time. Additionally, I've pretty much made my feelings on a<br />
host of subjects known for decades. I hate being repetitive. I loathe<br />
listening to repetition, and I revile having to sound like a parrot.<br />
</p>

<p>
WIth that said, I've recently felt the need to start writing and<br />
blogging again. I have no idea how long this will last. Maybe one post -<br />
maybe more. The one thing that I can say is that this may indeed turn<br />
out to be the most interesting year of my life so far. And with 2020 and<br />
2022 in hindsight, that's saying quite a lot.<br />

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-blogs-arent-what-they-used-to-be">
<p>
Back in the day (the dark ages), I used to have a very popular politics<br />
blog at the time. It's long gone now, but it used to be a thing. I<br />
eventually burned out on it and stopped altogether (again, having failed<br />
to stop repeating myself). However, it seems like blogs became more and<br />
more of a niche thing for many years with the rising popularity of<br />
social media apps.<br />
</p>

<p>
Now, howeer, they seem to <i>maybe</i> be coming back, with the public<br />
souring more and more on social media as a whole. There are many reasons<br />
to want Twitter and even Facebook to burn and die a horrid death, but<br />
perhaps bringing some sanity back into the discourse through longform<br />
posts is one of the best.<br />

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-i-havent-posted-anything-on-the-gaza-war">
<p>
I've tried a few times, and actually wrote about 20 pages worth of posts<br />
on the subject, but I kept getting disheartened and stopped before ever<br />
publishing my thoughts on the matter. I feel perhaps that, for now, it's<br />
for the best. Though, I may have something to say about it in the<br />
future. But if you know me, you probably already know my positions<br />
anyway.<br />

<p>
I've made myself fairly clear on where I stand here as well. If you're<br />
voting for anyone except for Biden at this point, you're voting to put a<br />
dictator in power and I want to have nothing to do with you.<br />

<p>
Again: My position is incredibly lucid and clear on this point. Ukraine<br />
has to win. What is there more to say? The Republican party is a party<br />
which not only supports having a dictator in the U.S. but also supports<br />
dictators abroad.<br />

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-elon-musk">
<p>
Elon Musk is the biggest liar in tech, and I've known this for many<br />
years. Apparently, this comes somewhat as a surprise to many people.<br />
This only demonstrates yet another state of affairs, the thought of<br />
which brings further depression. How anyone could fall of his incessant<br />
lies and bullshit for so long is beyond me. The man has been a snake oil<br />
salesman since his entire career. All of his claims in tech have been<br />
debunked. People like to point to SpaceX - which he honestly has nothing<br />
to do with in working terms - and Tesla - which he did not start or<br />
invent. It's thoroughly depressing that some of us have been saying this<br />
for so many years, and no one has been listening until recently. And<br />
they still don't listen because even many in the press still think he's<br />
a "genius" of <i>some</i> kind.<br />
</p>

<p>
He isn't, and he never has been.<br />
