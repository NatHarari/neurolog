As previous posts have explained, I used to really love Hugo. With Emacs, it was pretty easy to post stuff. It was also pretty easy to just use a template out of the box - a trap which I learned over the years really becomes exceedingly annoying.<br />
</p>

<p>
You see, every time Hugo updated (and it updates quite a lot), the template would break. More than half the time, this means that I couldn't post without having to update the template by hand and fix errors. When you have a template and you customize it yourself quite a lot, this becomes very taxing to do each and every time.<br />
</p>

<p>
Added to that: Every year or so, I'd need to get a new deployment script for publishing my website, which was also annoying.<br />
</p>

<p>
And why bother with all of that when I have Emacs in the first place with Org Mode? There was literally no need to use Hugo in any way whatsoever. With this setup, I can publish directly to my site from Emacs, no scripts locally or remotely to use, and it's not going to break the templates I make when I update. So, there it is: An Org Mode site, purely done in Org publishing natively to HTML, and pushed to my site. It works wonderfully well.<br />
</p>

<p>
I hope you like it. I kind of do. I'm still working on it a little bit but I want to keep it fairly simple as it's a simple blog.<br />
