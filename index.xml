It&amp;rsquo;s a nice enough website presenting apps such as Things, Evernote, Toggl, etc&amp;hellip; Naturally, however, I&amp;rsquo;m (once again) hit by the realisation that Org Mode (and Emacs) literally does all of this in one &amp;ldquo;package&amp;rdquo;, so to speak. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly impressive when you think about it, just how powerful it all is.</description></item><item><title>Social Media Annoyances</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/social-media-annoyances/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 06:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/social-media-annoyances/</guid><description>Facebook is trying to get my attention I haven&amp;rsquo;t been on social media in years.
Apart from the odd post once every 4-6 months (at the most), I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted at all on Facebook - let alone Instagram, LinkedIn, or any other venue. But Facebook and Instagram keep bugging me for my attention. Notification after notification come up on my iPad and iPhone telling me that &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo; reacted to a a post you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet commented on.</description></item><item><title>Early Spring Cleaning</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/early-spring-cleaning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 06:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/early-spring-cleaning/</guid><description>Time to Get Shit DoneTM It&amp;rsquo;s time for an early spring cleaning.
I know, it&amp;rsquo;s only February, but I have to Get Shit DoneTM I&amp;rsquo;m going to try Trademarking that at some point. &amp;ldquo;Getting Things Done&amp;rdquo; is too lackadaisical to mean that you&amp;rsquo;re getting serious, in my opinion - with all due respect to David Allen. &amp;ldquo;Things&amp;rdquo; just doesn&amp;rsquo;t convey the necessity of some tasks which have to get done for me in my life at this point.</description></item><item><title>Old People and Phones</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/old-people-calls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 06:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/old-people-calls/</guid><description>Old people and phones Somebody really needs to start a global program to teach old people that the one thing they should never do is hold their telephone up to their ear when a person video calls them.

Again. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find inspiration to write when the world has just gone to shit since such a very long time. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much made my feelings on a host of subjects known for decades. I hate being repetitive. I loathe listening to repetition, and I revile having to sound like a parrot.
WIth that said, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently felt the need to start writing and blogging again.</description></item><item><title>There Are No Kings in Rome</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/there-are-no-kings-in-rome/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 05:34:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/there-are-no-kings-in-rome/</guid><description>There Are No Kings in Rome I have been utterly aghast at the discourse in the media over the last two years in regards to Trump. The assumption - in all media, by the way - is that Trump would be able to pardon himself if he became the President.
Do people actually hear themselves saying this? Do people understand what they are saying? Have all of our history and social studies classes taught the entire population literally nothing about this concept?</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/chatgpt-dnd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 07:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/chatgpt-dnd/</guid><description>ChatGPT Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons As a fun little experiment last night, I had ChatGPT write out a little Dungeons and Dragons adventure. From what I learned: You can get ChatGPT to be really specific and detailed. There are a few tricks which my repeated attempts have taught me:
You have to be really specific and detailed in your query. You can make it a very long sentence.

I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand how I set it up this way but I was following instructions from a tutorial which had it set up like that.
When I tried to remove the setup, it of course borked everything up. I gave up for a bit in frustration because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a priority for me and I knew I&amp;rsquo;d have to sit down and re-up everything and set everything up from scratch to a new repo.</description></item><item><title>New Mastodon - Qoto.org</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/new-mastodon-qoto/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/new-mastodon-qoto/</guid><description>New Mastodon I migrated from the Mastodon server emacs.ch to qoto.org.
I still love emacs.ch but qoto has some more benefits, such as a 65,535 char post limit and a few other things. That&amp;rsquo;s huge. That&amp;rsquo;s enormous, in fact. It&amp;rsquo;s also a STEM-based instance, so there&amp;rsquo;s still some interesting things going on. So my new Mastodon is @natharari@qoto.org.
Also: I really ought to update this blog more often. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I don&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>Computer Literacy</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/computer-literacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/computer-literacy/</guid><description>Computer Literacy I&amp;rsquo;m going to say something completely impolitic, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care at this point about appearances:
I just have the feeling that most people are too stupid to actually figure out how easy #Mastodon is to use because of:
Choice and Unfamiliarity I remember when the internet was in its heyday (I was on it back in 1989 actually - but that&amp;rsquo;s another story) and we had such high hopes for humanity learning, growing, and communicating together.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/mastodon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/mastodon/</guid><description>Mastodon I&amp;rsquo;m on Mastodon (links above) at Counter Social, and more and more at @natharari@emacs.ch. I&amp;rsquo;m going to delete my Twitter soon or deactivate it if possible, as I have no confidence in that medium whatsoever. More and more people are leaving and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I&amp;rsquo;m one of them. Even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the site for the last few years, I just want no part of that disaster area.</description></item><item><title>Warp.dev</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/warp-dev/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/warp-dev/</guid><description>warp terminal I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across warp - a new terminal application currently for Mac only and in beta. Apparently they are working on a Linux and Windows release as well.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty fantastic. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly fast and very modern, written in Rust, and can do things no other terminal can do that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.
As a long time user of iTerm, it includes some functions which iTerm currently does not have.</description></item><item><title>What were the 70s...</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/what-were-the-70s-like/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 07:40:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/what-were-the-70s-like/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;What were the 70s and early 80s really like?&amp;rdquo; They were dark, very contrasty, and grainy with lots of muted colours.</description></item><item><title>Nintendo Egg Game</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/egg-game/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/egg-game/</guid><description>A blast from the past I was cleaning out some more things today and I found this gem. It&amp;rsquo;s from the early 80s and I must have spent countless hours with my brother and even my parents playing this little game.
I looked online and they actually sell for quite a bit of money so I may actually end up selling it. I honestly have no intention of ever playing it again, but it was nice to see it again and yes, it does work.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye old MacBook Pro</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/goodbye-old-macbook-pro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/goodbye-old-macbook-pro/</guid><description>Goodbye Old 2011 MacBook Pro. Yes, another &amp;ldquo;Goodbye&amp;rdquo; post from me - in so short a time. But this one is a must. I got this wonderful machine back in December 2011 and it&amp;rsquo;s been with me in Israel, Japan, the UK, and France. It was a workhorse for a very long time. But two and a half years ago I stopped using it in favour of the newer MacBook Pro I had for two years before getting my current one.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye Morning Bears</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/goodbye-morning-bears/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/goodbye-morning-bears/</guid><description>Goodbye morning bears. I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting a picture of a polar bear every single morning on Facebook since something like 2014 or 2015, without fail. And, as much as I love polar bears, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to say goodbye to this morning tradition.
I started it because I wanted to see something happy first thing in the morning before anything else. But it has long since worn out that usefulness for me.</description></item><item><title>Ahhh...Lunch</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/ahhh-lunch/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/ahhh-lunch/</guid><description>Ahhh&amp;hellip;Lunch.</description></item><item><title>Added Comments</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/added-comments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/added-comments/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added comments. In the extremely unlikely occurrence that anyone would ever comment on my site, I&amp;rsquo;ve added comments from Disqus.

After all: Isn&amp;rsquo;t Trump supposed to be the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; President? If he was really in charge&amp;hellip;why would the FBI raid his &amp;ldquo;inner sanctum&amp;rdquo;? Why would he have a warrant for a search?
What I&amp;rsquo;m really wondering is: How much information that counters their stupid, cretinous, &amp;ldquo;world view&amp;rdquo; does it take to snap them out of it? Will they ever actually snap out of it or will it just be a gradual process of moving on to the &amp;ldquo;next thing&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>A Terrorist Party</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/a-terrorist-party/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/a-terrorist-party/</guid><description>The Republicans are a terrorist party. I want to be absolutely clear: I mean that the Republicans are a terrorist party in the exact same way as Hamas is a terrorist party in most democracies (including the United States).
This is a political party which supported, and still supports, political violence to overthrow the democratically elected government of the United States - and a good chunk of which wants to install a theocratic government in its stead.</description></item><item><title>The FBI Raid on Trump</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/the-fbi-raid-on-trump/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/the-fbi-raid-on-trump/</guid><description>Don&amp;rsquo;t celebrate yet. With the recent FBI raid on Trump&amp;rsquo;s home, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some people celebrating as if it&amp;rsquo;s all coming to a head. I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth stepping back for a moment to realize that we should be unconvinced of any progress to put Trump in jail until such time as he&amp;rsquo;s actually in jail.
The fact is that I cannot, for the life of me, see Trump ever going to jail.</description></item><item><title>Skyrim and Emacs</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/skyrim-and-emacs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/skyrim-and-emacs/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely loving my MacBook Pro M1 Max What amazes me is how fast it is. Before, on the Intel MacBook Pro, I used to run Skyrim (and Fallout 4 as well as some other games) in native Windows mode. So, basically, it was like I was booting up a PC. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t have real access to my Mac Desktop or apps or anything else. The M1 is so fast that it&amp;rsquo;s running Skyrim in Parallels, at a faster FPS and far more stable than it was in native mode (I have no idea why but I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining).</description></item><item><title>xbar</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/xbar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/xbar/</guid><description>xbar is really cool. Recently, I found a very, very useful app for the Mac called xbar. It&amp;rsquo;s free and incredibly powerful and community-driven. Here is the link: xbar.
What it does is it puts a litle thing in your menu bar up top where you can load an enormous amount of plugins. These are written by all sorts of other people and fully open source. You have to figure out a little bit of code, like where your own directories are etc&amp;hellip; but you can install these plugins, edit them to fit your needs (the code is fully public so there won&amp;rsquo;t be any hacking of your system), and make it do whatever you want it to do.</description></item><item><title>Getting Up</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/getting-up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/getting-up/</guid><description>Getting up and walking around and doing things is good for you. I bought an Apple Watch several months ago. It&amp;rsquo;s my first smart watch and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier about it.
I did my research. I didn&amp;rsquo;t just buy it, and obviously I didn&amp;rsquo;t jump onto the bandwagon immediately after they first started coming out. It took years. I thought that it would be sort of useless for me to get one.</description></item><item><title>Dracula Theme</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/dracula-theme/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 16:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/dracula-theme/</guid><description>I really like Dracula Theme for Emacs. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying the Dracula Theme for about a week or so and I really enjoy it. It&amp;rsquo;s colourful and beautiful. It&amp;rsquo;s going on my permanent rotation for dark themes. I rotate between light and dark ones (light in the morning, dark at night) every day but I only keep the ones which please me the best, so my list is rather small.</description></item><item><title>Apple Reminders vs. Org Agenda</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/reminders-vs-org-agenda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/reminders-vs-org-agenda/</guid><description>I’ve decided a few things about Org Mode. Org mode is an amazing tool - probably the best planner/organizer/todo list/outiner/editor system there ever was and is. In fact, I know of non-coders who have learned Emacs just to be able to use org-mode. And learning Emacs is not for the faint of heart. But org-mode is that powerful that it entices people towards it who would never normally touch code with a ten foot pole.</description></item><item><title>Added About Page</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/added-about-page/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 21:32:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/added-about-page/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added an About page. I&amp;rsquo;ve just added an &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page on the top menu.
I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything here yet of value, but it will come. I did write an absolute rant about Facebook yesterday but I have yet to post it because it is rather harsh. My intention is to finalize it and then post it to Facebook for everyone to see. But we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I really feel like yelling at all the blind sheep who continue to use that place.</description></item><item><title>Hugo and Emacs</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/hugo-and-emacs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 23:30:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/hugo-and-emacs/</guid><description>I’m installing two Emacs packages which help with Hugo sites. I intend on publishing directly from Emacs without ever having to go to the CLI. Not that I don’t love the CLI - I do. I just want to be able to do everything directly from an Emacs interface. So far, i’m having a blast figuring this stuff out and reading the docs. Maybe there’s an IFTTT thing I can use to directly publish a link to Mastadon when I post.</description></item><item><title>Second Post</title><link>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/second-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 16:30:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/second-post/</guid><description>Working on the template Now I have to customise this template a little more.
