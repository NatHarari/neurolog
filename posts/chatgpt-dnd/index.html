I’ll post mine below so that you can see. It probably could have gone better but it was about 30 minutes before I went to sleep so I was fairly tired.\nYou can ask it questions based on previous queries so it knows what you’re talking about. This means that if the output is too long, break it down into a sort of outline. Then ask questions about each sub-item. It will know what you’re referring to.\nEvery time it generates something, it will be slightly or even hugely different - it depends what you’re asking it to do. So if the first attempt doesn’t succeed, try again. Even trying again with the same query will have a different output.\nI wanted this to be a little adventure about my friend Josh and I from our heyday back in the mid-80s. The Trident of Fish Command is a continual joke with us since almost 40 years as it was one of the prizes in a hoard of an adventure which sent us roaring into laughter. We deemed this to be one of the most useless magical items in D\u0026D at the time. We still joke about it today fairly regularly to denote something utterly useless. (You may have had to be there to get the entirety of the joke**\nMy Query: Write a detailed Dungeons and Dragons adventure. It must contain the following: Joshus Kolchinus is a Dwarven Cleric who is also a librarian. His friend, Slartibart, is a surly old mage who cackles at the misfortunes of his enemies. They start in a tavern and have at least five paragraphs of conversation of previous adventures together. Detail the tavern, the cost of the beer and rooms, and what they are equipped with as well. Then they hear of a dungeon not far away from a conversation next to them. Detail the surrounding area outside of the dungeon with at least 3 encounters. Detail all of the encounters with monsters as well as their treasure. Each encouter rewards includes gold, silver, jewels, items, and magical items. Detail all of that. Then, they enter the Dungeon. The dungeon has at least 30 rooms and at least 12 encounters with random monsters. Detail all of the monsters. They also have treasure which can include gold, silver, copper, electrum, magical items and jewels. Detail each treasure hoard. The dungeon also has several traps, which you need to detail as well, and it also has 3 puzzles, which also need to be detailed. At the end of the dungeon is a vast cavern with a sea serpent, which needs to have detailed statistics as well, and a vast treasure hoard containing gold, silver, electrum, copper, jewels, art, and magical items. All of this has to be detailed. It also contains a trident of fish command as the main prize which also needs details. I need the statistics of each monster in each encounter as well as the statistics of each item found in the dungeon. I also need the details of the puzzles and traps. List all of the monster details at the end of the adventure. And write out a text map of the surrounding area outside and the dungeon inside.\nResult:\nTitle: The Quest for the Trident of Fish Command\nJoshus Kolchinus, a Dwarven Cleric, and his friend, Slartibart, a surly old mage, sit at a wooden table in the smoky, dimly lit tavern. The tavern is packed with travelers, adventurers, and locals all in search of a drink and a story. Joshus and Slartibart order two frothy mugs of ale and begin recounting their past adventures together over a plate of roasted boar.\nAs they reminisce, they overhear a group of adventurers at the next table mentioning a nearby dungeon rumored to be filled with treasure. The two friends perk up their ears and make their way over to listen in on the conversation. After a few moments of eavesdropping, they learn that the dungeon is located just a few miles west of the tavern, near a dense forest. Excited by the prospect of treasure, Joshus and Slartibart head to the bar to pay for their ale and rooms.\nThe cost of a mug of ale is 1 silver piece, and the cost of a room for the night is 5 gold pieces. The rooms are equipped with a sturdy bed, a wooden chest for storing personal belongings, and a small table and chair for writing. Joshus and Slartibart each purchase a room for the night.\nAs they prepare to set out to the dungeon the next morning, they encounter three different obstacles on the way:\nA group of goblins attempting to rob travelers on the road. The goblins are armed with rusty swords and makeshift shields. The party defeats the goblins and finds a small treasure hoard containing 75 silver pieces and a Potion of Healing.\nA bridge over a rushing river has collapsed, forcing the party to either wade through the icy water or find another way across. They eventually find a fallen tree that can be used as a makeshift bridge.\nA group of wolves block the path, snarling and baring their teeth. The party successfully scares off the wolves with a well-timed Thunderwave spell from Slartibart. They find a small treasure hoard containing 50 silver pieces and a Ring of Animal Friendship.\nThe dungeon has 35 rooms, and the party encounters 12 different types of monsters. Here are the details of the encounters, along with the treasure found:\nA group of skeletons guarding a small room. The skeletons wield rusty swords and shields. The treasure hoard contains 100 copper pieces and a Potion of Water Breathing.\nA mimic disguised as a treasure chest. The mimic lashes out at the party with its sticky tentacles. The treasure hoard contains 300 gold pieces and a Wand of Magic Missiles.\nA group of orcs lounging in a common room. The orcs are armed with battleaxes and shields. The treasure hoard contains 200 gold pieces and a Scroll of Protection from Energy.\nA pack of giant spiders lurking in a web-filled corridor. The spiders pounce on the party with their venomous fangs. The treasure hoard contains 150 silver pieces and a Bag of Holding.\nA swarm of rats in a kitchen. The rats scurry and squeak as they attack the party. The treasure hoard contains 75 copper pieces and a Ring of Jumping.\nA group of lizardfolk guards defending a key to a locked door. The lizardfolk use their sharp claws to attack. The treasure hoard contains 500 silver pieces and a Staff of Frost.\nA room filled with animated furniture, including a chair, a table, and a chandelier. The furniture comes to life and attacks the party. The treasure hoard contains 350 gold pieces and a Wand of Fireballs.\nA pit with a gelatinous cube lurking inside. The cube engulfs the party members, attempting to digest them. The treasure hoard contains 100 electrum pieces and a Cloak of Elvenkind.\nA group of kobolds defending their treasure hoard. The kobolds use cunning traps and ambush tactics to attack the party. The treasure hoard contains 300 copper pieces and a Ring of Shielding.\nA dark, damp room with a patch of mold growing on the wall. The mold releases a cloud of poisonous spores. The treasure hoard contains 250 silver pieces and a Potion of Invisibility.\nA group of ghouls, reanimated corpses with sharp claws and teeth. The ghouls lunge at the party, attempting to paralyze them. The treasure hoard contains 400 gold pieces and a Staff of Healing.\nA beholder, a floating eyeball monster with multiple eye stalks. The beholder attacks the party with its disintegration ray and telekinetic ray. The treasure hoard contains 1000 gold pieces and a Wand of Polymorph.\nAlong the way, the party also encounters several traps and puzzles:\nA pressure plate in the floor of a narrow hallway triggers a trap that unleashes a hail of poisoned darts. The party must either find a way around the plate or disarm the trap.\nA riddle inscribed on a stone tablet blocks the way to one of the rooms. The party must decipher the riddle to proceed.\nA room filled with mirrors and illusions. The party must use keen observation to identify the correct path through the maze of mirrors.\nAt the end of the dungeon, the party enters a vast cavern with a massive sea serpent coiled in the center. The serpent lashes out at the party with its sharp teeth and tail. Here are the sea serpent’s statistics:\nSea Serpent Type: Huge Beast Armor Class: 18 Hit Points: 250 Speed: 40 ft., swim 80 ft.

Here are the trident’s statistics:\nTrident of Fish Command Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement) This trident has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. It has 3 charges.

I know it wasn’t the best method to use, but it ended up working. I believe I ran out of tokens for the Ghouls which should be 11, but no matter. The example is clear enough and the adventure is fairly complete. You can, as a Dungeon Master, create an entire module pretty quickly (each output only took 1 or 2 seconds to start scrolling out). You could, for instance, work on each “Chapter” or “Section” one at a time and get a much more refined dungeon or adventure. What used to take hours to do can now be done in a matter of seconds. Of course, it won’t be instant. There’s a lot of refining to do, a lot of attempts to make it work, but it will still save you a tremendous amount of time.\nI’m absolutely certain that there are much better and more detailed adventures out there already created with ChatGPT, but I didn’t go looking for them at all yet. I just wanted to use it as an experiment to learn how to use the interface and tailor the results. I think that it worked very well overall. It can still use some work, but it’s a bang-up job for having come up with this result in only one or two seconds.\n","wordCount":"2507","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-04-27T07:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2023-04-27T07:00:00+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nathaniel Harari"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/chatgpt-dnd/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"a neuro[log]","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.neurolog.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/ accesskey=h title="a neuro[log] (Alt + H)">a neuro[log]</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/archives/ title=log><span>log</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>ChatGPT Dungeons & Dragons</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-04-27 07:00:00 +0200 +0200'>April 27, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Nathaniel Harari</div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=chatgpt-dungeons--dragons>ChatGPT Dungeons & Dragons<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chatgpt-dungeons--dragons>#</a></h1><p>As a fun little experiment last night, I had ChatGPT write out a little Dungeons and Dragons adventure.

The Trident of Fish Command is a continual joke with us since almost 40 years as it was one of the prizes in a hoard of an adventure which sent us roaring into laughter. We deemed this to be one of the most useless magical items in D&D at the time. We still joke about it today fairly regularly to denote something utterly useless.

I believe I ran out of tokens for the Ghouls which should be 11, but no matter. The example is clear enough and the adventure is fairly complete. You can, as a Dungeon Master, create an entire module pretty quickly (each output only took 1 or 2 seconds to start scrolling out). You could, for instance, work on each &ldquo;Chapter&rdquo; or &ldquo;Section&rdquo; one at a time and get a much more refined dungeon or adventure. What used to take hours to do can now be done in a matter of seconds. Of course, it won&rsquo;t be instant. There&rsquo;s a lot of refining to do, a lot of attempts to make it work, but it will still save you a tremendous amount of time.</p><p>I&rsquo;m absolutely certain that there are much better and more detailed adventures out there already created with ChatGPT, but I didn&rsquo;t go looking for them at all yet. I just wanted to use it as an experiment to learn how to use the interface and tailor the results. I think that it worked very well overall. It can still use some work, but it&rsquo;s a bang-up job for having come up with this result in only one or two seconds.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/tags/dnd/>dnd</a></li><li><a href=https://www.neurolog.dev/tags/chatgpt/>chatgpt</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.neurolog.dev/posts/there-are-no-kings-in-rome/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>There Are No Kings in Rome</span></a>
