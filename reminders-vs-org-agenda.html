<p>
Org mode is an amazing tool - probably the best planner/organizer/todo<br />
list/outiner/editor system there ever was and is. In fact, I know of<br />
non-coders who have learned Emacs just to be able to use org-mode. And<br />
learning Emacs is not for the faint of heart. But org-mode is that<br />
powerful that it entices people towards it who would never normally<br />
touch code with a ten foot pole.<br />
</p>

<p>
However, I've found that it has one failing: It has limited mobile<br />
capabilities.<br />
</p>

<p>
Now, I know that people will point to <a href="https://beorgapp.com">Beorg</a><br />
and other apps (I use the excellent <a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a><br />
myself), but you can't really edit things so easily on the fly, and you<br />
can't build your org-mode agenda from those files in any way that I can<br />
see. It's just a bit of a hassle.<br />
</p>

<p>
Enter Apple Reminders. Better than Apple Calender for many things, I use<br />
Apple Reminders for everything non-computer/project related. Meaning:<br />
Chores, shopping lists, repeating tasks around the house or in the real<br />
world. I save org for anything that requires me to be at the computer.<br />
That way, I can carry my tasks around with me related to the real world,<br />
and save the excellent project management system of org-mode for my<br />
computer when it's fully available.<br />
</p>

<p>
I find myself saving links to Plain Org all the time (I have an<br />
inbox.org and a refile system which works wonders) and I can open those<br />
files up on my phone or iPad with no problems whatsoever. But for the<br />
tasks themselves, I use Apple Reminders.<br />
</p>

<p>
Apple Reminders is getting better and better every year. They now have<br />
smart tags which work in conjunction with Apple Notes (which I also use<br />
for a few non-computer things). This way, you can build smart lists,<br />
such as Weekly Chores, Daily Chores, Bi-Monthly Chores, etc&#x2026;all<br />
related to the real world for me and not the computer one. You can set<br />
geotag location things to pop up when you're in an area (if you bother<br />
to set that up, which I have) so that you won't forget to do or buy<br />
something when you're there. It also looks very&#x2026; “Apple”. Meaning:<br />
Minimalist, colourful, simple and easy. In fact I've taken out many of<br />
my repeating tasks and reminders from Apple's Calendar (also very good),<br />
and put them into Reminders in my smart lists.<br />
</p>

<p>
This way, I'm starting an entirely easy to manage set of two systems<br />
which could not be easier to decide upon: Is it related to my computer<br />
and something online? Then it goes into org-mode. If not, it goes into<br />
Apple Reminders.<br />
</p>

<p>
It also allows me to minimalise the amounts of data I have in org-mode<br />
at any given time and concentrate fairly large plans and writing just in<br />
that system alone, so that I don't clutter up my nicely managed<br />
Reminders system.<br />
