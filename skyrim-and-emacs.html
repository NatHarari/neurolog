What amazes me is how fast it is. Before, on the Intel MacBook Pro, I<br />
used to run Skyrim (and Fallout 4 as well as some other games) in native<br />
Windows mode. So, basically, it was like I was booting up a PC. But I<br />
didn't have real access to my Mac Desktop or apps or anything else. The<br />
M1 is so fast that it's running Skyrim in Parallels, at a faster FPS and<br />
far more stable than it was in native mode (I have no idea why but I'm<br />
not complaining). The graphics are much better as well - there is no<br />
comparison. Plus, it doesn't even get hot. I can literally run it on my<br />
lap (there was no way of doing that before&#x2026;ever.)<br />
</p>

<p>
But the best part is: I have access to all my Mac stuff, including<br />
Emacs. I used to put all my Skyrim notes in Apple Notes to view them on<br />
my iPad or iPhone while playing. But now I can use Emacs because it runs<br />
right next to it with no problem. Just Command-Tab to switch back and<br />
forth. It's much better in lots of ways. Plus, with Plain Org, I can<br />
keep viewing my Skyrim notes on my iPad or iPhone anytime I want (as<br />
well as everything else). It's honestly fantastic.<br />
</p>

<p>
That and with me running mu4e in emacs for email, I don't have to just<br />
rely on my iPhone or iPad to view emails in fastmail. I can just go<br />
right to emacs and check out my emails while I'm enjoying Skyrim.<br />
