<p>
There are huge strikes today in France because of the proposed reforms<br />
by Macron to increase the retirement age.<br />
</p>

<p>
What bothers me about French unions is their tactics - and this applies<br />
to most unions across the world, but particularly in France.<br />
</p>

<p>
Here, when the unions are upset about legislation, or want to make their<br />
power felt, they go on big general strikes and they tend to block<br />
traffic. It's incredibly annoying. It isn't that I oppose their goals<br />
necessarily because I think that some things (quality of life for<br />
instance) are worth fighting for. That's a good thing. But I completely<br />
oppose their tactics.<br />
</p>

<p>
You see, the people making these laws are never really inconvenienced.<br />
They know that the strikes are happening, but it doesn't affect <i>their</i><br />
daily lives. The lives affected are from the general population.<br />
</p>

<p>
A better point to be made would be to block all of the traffic around<br />
The Elysée Palace. That's where the head of government is. You wouldn't<br />
get ignored at that point and the general population would be left<br />
alone. Naturally, no one ever does this. Why?<br />
</p>

<p>
Well, I've asked French people about this idea and they just shrug and<br />
say it's not how it's done. And they don't think about that. They just<br />
assume that this is something they have to live with in their daily<br />
lives from time to time, and that's just the way it is.<br />
</p>

<p>
But it's patently idiotic. And, quite frankly, it's cowardly as well.<br />
</p>

<p>
Let's say that the guy upstairs is bigger than me and he's playing loud<br />
music all night. I'm not going to go to the weaker guy next door and<br />
start protesting to make my point because he's easy to beat up - just to<br />
show the guy upstairs that I mean business. It's a bit like terrorist<br />
tactics, to be honest. I'm completely opposed to it.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying the unions are necessarily terrorists because I don't<br />
want to equate that with killing people. I am, however, saying that they<br />
are using the same tactics. It's undeniable. And they're doing it<br />
because it's easier to do this than to actually inconvenience the<br />
powers-that-be with a real protest.<br />
</p>

<p>
The unions here know that if they ever did block The Elysée Palace, it<br />
would be a pitched battle. But they already fight those. I think they're<br />
just afraid of what the people who actually hold power would do to<br />
disperse them. Again: A coward's position, and an illegitimate one.<br />
</p>

<p>
So, while I'm sympathetic to the causes of the unions from time to time,<br />
I end up not wanting to ever support them because of their idiotic and<br />
terrorist tactics. And I find the entire French attitude on the subject<br />
exasperating because they simply cannot envision any change for the<br />
better.<br />
