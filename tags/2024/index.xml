Again. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find inspiration to write when the world has just gone to shit since such a very long time. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much made my feelings on a host of subjects known for decades. I hate being repetitive. I loathe listening to repetition, and I revile having to sound like a parrot.
WIth that said, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently felt the need to start writing and blogging again.</description></item></channel></rss>
