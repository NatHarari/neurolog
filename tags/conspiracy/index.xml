After all: Isn&amp;rsquo;t Trump supposed to be the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; President? If he was really in charge&amp;hellip;why would the FBI raid his &amp;ldquo;inner sanctum&amp;rdquo;? Why would he have a warrant for a search?
What I&amp;rsquo;m really wondering is: How much information that counters their stupid, cretinous, &amp;ldquo;world view&amp;rdquo; does it take to snap them out of it? Will they ever actually snap out of it or will it just be a gradual process of moving on to the &amp;ldquo;next thing&amp;rdquo;?</description></item></channel></rss>
