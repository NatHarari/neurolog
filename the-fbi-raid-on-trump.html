<p>
With the recent FBI raid on Trump's home, I've seen some people<br />
celebrating as if it's all coming to a head. I think it's worth stepping<br />
back for a moment to realize that we should be unconvinced of any<br />
progress to put Trump in jail until such time as he's actually in jail.<br />
</p>

<p>
The fact is that I cannot, for the life of me, see Trump ever going to<br />
jail. There's no one I wish more in America to be in jail since <i>before</i><br />
he was first elected, but I think they'll never do it. They would have<br />
to build an entire new jail for him alone because of the requirements of<br />
his protection 24/7 as a former president (that term is not justified by<br />
his having held the position, but legally speaking&#x2026;)<br />
</p>

<p>
Frankly, if this were any other country in the democracies of the world,<br />
he would have been in jail on Jan 7th, as well as his lieutenants, and<br />
the entire Republican party would have been declared a terrorist party<br />
and legally disbanded. I remember when the right lost their collective<br />
minds because the left would be mealy-mouthed about what defines a<br />
terrorist. Well, as it turns out, the right have become our worst<br />
terrorists and they now refuse to see it as such. The people who worried<br />
the most about hypocrisy with terrorism and religiously imposed laws are<br />
now the literal worst offenders of our nation's history.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'll probably write more about this very shortly. I have a lot to say<br />
and I have been silent for years now because I no longer wished to use<br />
Facebook.<br />
