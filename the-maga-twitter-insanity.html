I was watching <i>The Bulwark</i> yesterday and this video came up: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wyhwB8VFTc">Inside MAGA’s Wildest Feud (Highly NSFW!)</a>. They're discussing the complete meltdown of "MAGA Influencers" fighting with each other in a way which is completely unhinged. One would imagine this is the kind of behaviour that one would only see in public at some sort of biker bar at three in the morning.<br />
</p>

<p>
But I have a couple of quick thoughts:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This cultural collapse which we have been witnessing for just around ten years or so - a significant amount of blame lies on the shoulders of the tech "giants". Twitter, Facebook, and others. They're all extremely bad. They sold us a model where we can keep in touch with our friends and families in a very easy way, but they magnified the insanity of completely crazy people to keep us hooked into their stupid Apps. I don't know what kind of legislation we could ever pass to change this, but something has to be done on a legal front. Thirty years ago, an extremist Nazi would not be feted with millions of followers. They'd be in a very small local group which everyone knew well enough to stay clear of. The internet has, however, magnified their voices so that they have realized there are millions of them all over the world and can band together in large groups. They can propagandise in ways which were unthinkable to them a few decades ago, and get more recruits faster than ever before. This is a huge problem and it needs to be addressed.<br /></li>
</ol>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The media at large is to blame for this as well. They all joined Twitter and the other networks to get more exposure, because no one was going to read their articles anymore (or watch their videos). But the fact that they're staying on Twitter today is criminal. They're enabling this platform and this madness by validating it as a place where you can still go to get legitimate news. If they all left en masse, there is a good chance that more and more mainstream people would leave as well because all that Twitter would become is a place for crazy people to scream and rant all day and put out racist and antisemitic propaganda.<br /></li>
</ol>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Not just the media but government agencies around the world - they need to leave those places as well. All of them. Their presence also validates the insanity on those platforms and it needs to stop.<br /></li>
</ol>


<p>
This social media Hellscape is what gave us Donald Trump, and what elected him a second time. It magnifies ignorance, bad behaviour, and brainwashes people. I'm including TikTok in there as well - It all has to be shunned by legitimate businesses, news organizations, and governments. These have to become corners of the internet where polite society simply will not engage.<br />
