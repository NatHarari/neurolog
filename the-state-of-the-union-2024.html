<p>
Given the state of the union in 2024, I have a few things I want to say:<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fascism won. Literally. The Republic is literally no more. You may<br />
have grand delusions about what is left of America, but they are just<br />
that: delusions. It's gone. The American Experiment is literally<br />
over.<br /></li>

<li>I blame the voters. I know that we're <i>never</i> supposed to do this,<br />
but I will: Most Americans, at this point, are fucking clueless<br />
idiots. That's not just me saying it, it's the majority of the nation<br />
who declared it in yesterday's vote. And if somebody says they didn't<br />
vote so they're not included: that includes them as well. Anyone who<br />
didn't bother to vote this scumbag into the dustbin of history is, at<br />
this point, a useless fucking moron.<br /></li>

<li>The Republican Party is dead and has been for some time. To any<br />
"Nikki Haley" voters out there: you're living in a fucking delusion<br />
as well.<br /></li>

<li>The Democratic Party is dead too. There's no recovering from this<br />
that I can see in the next few years because this was the last free<br />
election that will be held until the foreseeable future. If you think<br />
that the Republicans were already cheating with their districts, just<br />
wait and see what they do the next time around. Your vote doesn't<br />
matter anymore. It's what Putin did, and it's what they are going to<br />
do as well.<br /></li>

<li>Trump is never leaving the White House. He's going to die there,<br />
regardless of how many years it will take. By then, the Supreme Court<br />
will have ruled on so many things regarding Republican gerrymandering<br />
that it won't matter anyway.<br /></li>

<li>The Russians have won the war. That's painful to say, but it's true.<br />
There's nothing that we can do about it. They literally have a man<br />
who will tell them anything they want to hear in the seat of the<br />
Presidency and, even better for them, as the Vice President in case<br />
anything should happen to Trump. The only place Ukraine can find<br />
support now will be with Europe, and Europe isn't equipped to handle<br />
it. It should be, and it should get its ass in gear right now to<br />
create a European Union defense, but it can't handle what is coming<br />
in 3 months. Oh, and NATO? It's dead.<br /></li>

<li>Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and all the other billionaires who supported<br />
Trump just not only undermined all of American Democracy but killed<br />
it off. If there is a revolution, they should be first up against the<br />
wall.<br /></li>

<li>The Democrats have completely fucked up. For two years, they did<br />
nothing but sit on their hands under their asses in the hopeless<br />
thought that somehow "normalcy" was going to return. Those of us who<br />
were screaming for Trump and his cohorts to be prosecuted were told<br />
we should let bygones be bygones. Guess what? If people had listened<br />
to us, if people had done what we had asked, we wouldn't be here now.<br />
Great fucking job.<br /></li>

<li>The rule of law is dead. Apparently a <i>coup d'état</i> is perfectly<br />
acceptable and a President is unaccountable for treason.<br /></li>

<li>I'm completely disengaging from all political content for a long<br />
while. I'm probably also going to delete my Facebook in the near<br />
future, just as I did with Twitter. I see literally no harm in doing<br />
so. If people want to reach out to me, they can fucking learn to use<br />
Email again.<br /></li>
