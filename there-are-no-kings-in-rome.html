I have been utterly aghast at the discourse in the media over the last<br />
two years in regards to Trump. The assumption - in <i>all</i> media, by the<br />
way - is that Trump would be able to pardon himself if he became the<br />
President.<br />
</p>

<p>
Do people <i>actually</i> hear themselves saying this? Do people <i>understand</i><br />
what they are saying? Have all of our history and social studies classes<br />
taught the entire population literally <i>nothing</i> about this concept?<br />
</p>

<p>
It is astounding to me that nobody is countering this. Not even on<br />
MSNBC, where liberal and anti-Trump rhetoric resides (thankfully).<br />
Everyone apparently is just comfortable with the idea that if he becomes<br />
the President, he could just <i>do</i> that - that they might not <i>like</i> it,<br />
but that is "the law".<br />
</p>

<p>
How can <i>anyone</i> believe this utter bullshit? How can <i>anyone</i> believe<br />
that this is "the law"?<br />
</p>

<p>
There are no kings in America. The Founding Fathers made it clear that a<br />
king was something which they utterly rejected. George Washington was<br />
quite bloody clear on this point when he became the first President of<br />
the United States.<br />
</p>

<p>
A President who can pardon himself can literally do anything. Even some<br />
autocrats sometimes have to <i>pretend</i> to have limits. But a President<br />
who can pardon himself doesn't have to pretend. He can literally round<br />
up 10,000,000 Americans and gun them down and the law could not touch<br />
him. He could genocide any racial, ethnic, or otherwise group in the<br />
USA, and the law could not touch him. He could literally behead people<br />
live on TV, and the law could not touch him. He would be above the<br />
Constitution, and above any justice whatsoever.<br />
</p>

<p>
He would be above Congress, and above the Supreme Court.<br />
</p>

<p>
For a Presidential candidate to even entertain the possibility of a<br />
self-pardon should be tantamount to treason.<br />
</p>

<p>
Is this really an <i>acceptable</i> position to have for <i>any</i> President?<br />
</p>

<p>
Not only that, but it would mean that <i>every</i> President in history, and<br />
<i>every</i> future President was, is, and will, be above the law. Do you<br />
think that sounds like the United States of America? Do you think that<br />
fits the ideals of a democracy, or even the barest framework of a<br />
republic?<br />
</p>

<p>
This should not be something which people just <i>assume</i> is the case.<br />
This should be such a huge and obvious blasphemy (and I don't use that<br />
word lightly) against the very ideals and foundation of the republic. It<br />
is <i>anathema</i> to our entire existence as a nation - historically and in<br />
the present day. One would hope that this would hold in the future as<br />
well.<br />
</p>

<p>
I implore everyone - <i>everyone</i> - to counter this assumption every time<br />
it is brought up. This is <i>not</i> acceptable. It is <i>not</i> something which<br />
should <i>ever</i> be allowed. It is <i>not</i> American in any sense whatsoever.<br />
I don't care who says anything to the contrary, they are wrong.<br />
</p>

<p>
Trump <i>cannot</i> simply pardon himself, nor should we <i>ever</i> allow it to<br />
happen.<br />
