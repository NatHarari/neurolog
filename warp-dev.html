I've recently come across <a href="https://www.warp.dev">warp</a> - a new<br />
terminal application currently for Mac only and in beta. Apparently they<br />
are working on a Linux and Windows release as well.<br />
</p>

<p>
It's pretty fantastic. It's incredibly fast and very modern, written in<br />
Rust, and can do things no other terminal can do that I've ever seen.<br />
</p>

<p>
As a long time user of iTerm, it includes some functions which iTerm<br />
currently does not have. I've been checking it out and it's a bit like<br />
VS Code if VS Code were a terminal application.<br />
</p>

<p>
Seeing as I've just completed a full command line course to learn some<br />
things I never did learn how to fully do before (such as intricate grep<br />
searches etc&#x2026;), I'm giving this a try. It has multiple cursors and you<br />
can also edit commands on the fly as you're typing them by clicking with<br />
the cursor. It also has an AI which lets you dwim without using actual<br />
commands.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'd say: Give it a try. One weird thing, however: They ask you to make a<br />
login. I'm not sure what the purpose is and I'll look further into that.<br />
Currently, I'm not doing anything sensitive, but if you are, I'd look<br />
into that first.<br />
</p>

<p>
Overall, it's been an amazing experience so far and their built in<br />
themes are really beautiful. The interface is very modern and fast. So,<br />
giving it a try for now and I'll see if I stick with it in the future.<br />
</p>

<p>
I don't think I'll ever completely get rid of iTerm though. That thing<br />
is still pretty amazing.<br />
